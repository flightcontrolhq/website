### Setting the commands in flightcontrol.json

You can use a `flightcontrol.json` file at the repo root, but you'll need to account for the path of the corresponding package when specifying the commands for the services, like so:

```json
"buildCommand": "cd apps/frontend && npm run build",
"startCommand": "cd apps/frontend && npm run start",
```

### Using nixpacks config file

If you want use a `nixpacks.toml` file in the packages of a monorepo, you'll need to have one individual `.toml` file for each package and then you'll need to add a `NIXPACKS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable to the service with the file path.

```json
{
  id: "production",
  name: "production",
  services: [
    {
      id: "frontend",
      buildType: "nixpacks",
      envVariables": {
        "NIXPACKS_CONFIG_FILE": "./apps/frontend/nixpacks.toml"
      }
      ...restOfConfig
    },
    {
      id: "backend",
      buildType: "nixpacks",
      envVariables": {
        "NIXPACKS_CONFIG_FILE": "./apps/backend/nixpacks.toml"
      }
      ...restOfConfig
    },
  ],
}
```
