To use your own file, you'll need to create a compatible JSON file and add it to the path you indicated in the configuration.

It can be useful to use our JSON schema for autocompletion: https://app.flightcontrol.dev/schema.json.

- Each git repo can have multiple `flightcontrol.json` files
- Each `flightcontrol.json` corresponds to a single `Project` (as shown in the Flightcontrol dashboard)
- Each `Project` can have multiple `Environment`'s
- Each `Environment` can have multiple `Service`'s

<Note type="info">
  üí° Tip: For autocompletion, you'll need to add `$schema` as a top-level property with our schema
  as the value: `"https://app.flightcontrol.dev/schema.json"`.
</Note>

## Top level `Project` Options

`environments: Environment[]`

- One or more environments in this project.
- Typically you‚Äôll have a `production` environment and a `staging` environment

`envVariables: EnvVariables`

- Environment variables configured at the top level will be automatically inherited by all environments and services in the file.
- You can override a specific env variable inside any environment or service

## `EnvVariables`

Environment variables can be configured two ways

1. In the Flightcontrol dashboard under an environment‚Äôs settings
2. Via flightcontrol.json (values defined here will override ones set in the dashboard)

   - object, with one or more of the following types

     - **Static**
       - Format: `"NAME": "<value>"`
       - Example: `"APP_ENV": "production"`
       - Static, hard coded value in flightcontrol.json
     - **From another service:**

       - Format: `"NAME": {"fromService": {"id": "<serviceId>", value: "<value>"}}`
       - Example: `"NAME": {"fromService": {"id": "db", value: "dbConnectionString"}}`
       - Supported values for `type: "rds"` services:
         `dbConnectionString, username, password, host, port`
         In preview environment we also include `dbName` and `dbEngine`.
       - Supported values for `type: "fargate"` and `type: "static"` services:

         `host` will include the service URL without protocol: `www.example.com`

         `origin` will include the service URL with protocol: `https://www.example.com`

     - **From Parameter Store:**
       - Format: `"NAME": {"fromParameterStore": "<parameterStoreItemName>"}`
       - Example: `"STRIPE_API_KEY": {"fromParameterStore": "ACME_STRIPE_API_KEY"}`
       - Securely retrieve the value from [AWS Parameter Store](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/parameters). Parameter Store is a free AWS service for securely storing secrets.
       - **Important: Your parameter store item must be in the same region as your service**

         />
     - **From Secrets Manager:**
       - Format: `"NAME": {"fromSecretsManager": "<arn:your-secret-arn>"}`
       - Example: `"STRIPE_API_KEY": {"fromSecretsManager": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-1:832786265645:secret:/stripe-y6uINZ"}`
       - Securely retrieve the value from [AWS Secrets Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/home). Secrets Manager is a paid AWS service for securely storing secrets. It costs $0.40/secret/month

- We automatically provide you with the following environment variables:
  - `CI=true`
  - `PORT=<your service.port value>`
  - `FORCE_COLOR=0`
  - `FC_URL=<current full url of the service>`
  - `FC_GIT_COMMIT_SHA=<git commit sha of the deployment>`
  - `FC_GIT_BRANCH=<git branch of the deployment>`
  - `FC_AWS_REGION=<aws region of the environment>`

## `Environment`

`id: string`

- Example: `"id": "production"`
- This is a string id that you create. We use it on each git push to match your config to your existing environment in AWS
- This should never be changed

`name: string`

- Example: `"name": "Production"`
- This is the name we use to display your environment in the Flightcontrol web dashboard

`region: string`

- Example: `"region": "us-west-2"`
- Supported values: [any valid aws region](https://awsregion.info/)
- This is the AWS region that all your services within this environment will be located
- Typically you want this to be close to your users.

`source: object`

- `branch: string`
  - Example: `"source": {"branch": "main"}`
  - The github branch you want deployed to this environment.
  - Every git push to this branch will be automatically deployed
- `trigger: string`
  - Example: `"trigger": "manual"`
  - Supported values: `"manual", "push"`
  - Optional with default to `"push"`
  - Leaving the trigger as `‚Äùpush‚Äù` will result in an automatic deployment of any git push to the branch. Changing the trigger to `"manual"` will prevent automatic deployments and require manually deploying the environment in the hamburger menu in the environment show page:

- `pr: true | undefined`
  - _Optional_, for configuring [Preview Environments](/guides/config/preview-environment)
- `filter.toBranches: string[] | undefined`
  - _Optional_, for configuring [Preview Environments](/guides/config/preview-environment)
  - Example: `"toBranches": ["main"]`
  - If set, only pull or merge requests to the specified branch(es) will be deployed as preview environments. If omitted, all pull requests will be deployed.
- `filter.labels: string[] | undefined`
  - _Optional_, for configuring [Preview Environments](/guides/config/preview-environment)
  - Example: `"labels": ["deploy-preview"]`
  - If set, only pull or merge requests with at least one of the specified labels will be deployed. It will be deployed when the label is added, whether that‚Äôs during PR creation or some time after the PR is opened.

<Note type="info">
  üí° Note: The optional filters work with an `AND` logic. If both filters are enabled, it will only
  deploy a PR that matches both the target branch(es) (`toBranches`) and one of the labels
  configured (`labels`).
</Note>

`vpc: object`

- This allows you to connect this environment to an existing VPC instead of creating a new one
- **Caveat:** This only works with new Environment deployments, if you have an existing environment deployed already, we cannot change the VPC, you will need to deploy a brand new environment, route your application traffic, then delete the old environment.
- Make sure you set this environment‚Äôs region to match the region of your VPC
- `id: string`
  - Example: `"id": "vpc-1234"`
  - Your VPC ID (not the VPC name)
  - Make sure to use a VPC in the region you defined
- `cidr: string`
  - Example: `"cidr": "10.10.1.0/24"`
  - _Optional:_ If you have a single CIDR attached to the VPC, you do not need to define a `CIDR`, as Flightcontrol will automatically use the default CIDR.
  - If the VPC has multiple CIDR attached, you can select the CIDR you want to use to deploy the application, using this parameter.

`envVariables: EnvVariables`

- Environment variables configured at the environment level will be automatically inherited by all the services within this environment
- You can override a specific env variable inside a specific service

`services: Service[]`

- These services will be deployed and updated together.
- These services exist inside the same VPC (each environment has it‚Äôs own VPC)

## `Service`

The following properties are common for all service types:

`id: string`

- Example: `"id": "production-web"`
- This is a string id that you create. We use it on each git push to match your config to your existing service in AWS
- This should never be changed

`name: string`

- Example: `"name": "Production Web"`
- This is the name we use to display your service in the Flightcontrol web dashboard

`buildType: 'nixpacks' | 'nodejs' | 'docker' | 'fromService' | 'fromRepository'`

- Example: `"buildType": "nixpacks"`
- Default: `'nodejs'`
- Nixpacks:
  - If you're using a monorepo, you'll likely want to pay attention to `basePath` and read [the guidance on monorepos](/guides/advanced/deploying-own-image)
  - Deploy almost any language without writing a Dockerfile!
  - Docs: [https://nixpacks.com/](https://nixpacks.com/)
  - You can customize native packages and such with [nixpacks.toml](https://nixpacks.com/docs/configuration/file)
- Node.js:
  - Behind the scenes, this uses a Flightcontrol provided Dockerfile.
  - This will be deprecated in favor of Nixpacks
- Docker:
  - Bring your own Dockerfile for full control
  - This is only supported for container based services like `fargate` and `fargate-worker`
- fromRepository:
  - Allows you to use a pre-built image from a repository
  - Requires you to create an [image registry](/guides/advanced/deploying-own-image) and add the `containerImage` parameter to your service config
  - This is only supported for container based services like `fargate` and `fargate-worker`
- fromService:
  - Used for single-tenet architectures where you want to build once but deploy to many services
  - Requires adding a `fromService: [serviceId]` parameter to your service config
  - This is only supported for container based services like `fargate` and `fargate-worker`

`watchPaths?: string[]`

- Example: `"watchPaths": ["apps/frontend/**"]`
- _Optional_
- This service will only build & deploy if there is a file change since the last successful deploy that matches the given glob pattern(s)
- Uses [`glob` patterns](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features)

    - HTTP status codes that signal healthy: `200-399`
    - This is used during deployment to ensure the server is healthy before traffic is routed to it. And during runtime, to automatically replace unhealthy servers. If you notice that your app is in a cycle of working and not working, it could be your health check path is returning an error causing the to keep restarting your server.

     `fromService: string`

    - If using `buildType: fromService`, this is the ID of the service that you wish to use the image for.

    `containerImage: object`

    - When set to true, changes to the RDS config will trigger a new deployment with the changes. When set to false, these changes will be applied at the next scheduled maintenance window. Refer to [AWS documentation on maintenance windows](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/rds-maintenance-window) if needed.
    - The next window for changes to be applied can be seen in the dashboard: <NextImage src={dashBoardPic} alt="Dashboard with maintenance window highlighted" />

    `engineVersion: string`

    - Example: `"engineVersion": "12"`
    - Supported values:
        - Postgres: `9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14` (NOTE: Only versions 9-12 have a free tier)
        - Mysql: `5.6, 5.7, 8`
        - Mariadb: `10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6`
    - Changing this will initiate a database upgrade. The database will be updated in the next scheduled maintenance window unless you set `applyChangesImmediately: true`

    `autoUpgradeMinorVersions: boolean`

    - Example: `‚ÄúautoUpgradeMinorVersions": true`
    - Optional with default: `true`

    `instanceSize: string`

    - Example: `"instanceSize": "db.t4g.micro"`
    - Support values: [See the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html)
    - Changing this will initiate a database upgrade. The database will be updated in the next scheduled maintenance window unless you set `applyChangesImmediately: true`

    `storage: int`

    - Example: `"storage": 20`
    - Support values: `20-65,536`
    - When increasing storage, AWS will automaticaly upgrade it by 20% if you increase the value less than 20
    - Changing this will initiate a database upgrade. The database will be updated in the next scheduled maintenance window unless you set `applyChangesImmediately: true`

    `maxStorage: string`

    - Example: `"maxStorage": 40`
    - Optional
    - Support values: `20-65,536`
    - For detailed autoscaling info, see [the AWS autoscaling docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling)

    `private: boolean`

    - Example: `"private": true`
    - Supported values: `true | false`
    - Incurs an extra ~$30/month AWS cost because of the NAT Gateway
    - Private means the database is not accessible from the internet. Public means it is. However, the database is fully secured when public, but it just allows attackers to try and brute force the secure credentials. Or try to find some vulnerability.

    `deletionProtection: boolean`

    - Example: `"deletionProtection": true`
    - Optional with default: `false`
    - Enabling this will prevent any user from deleting the database until it is changed
    - It‚Äôs recommended to enable this for production databases.

    `port: int`

    - Example: `"port": 1234`
    - Optional with default:
        - Postgres: `5432`
        - Mysql: `3306`
        - Mariadb: `3306`

    `basePath?: string` (only supported when `buildType: nixpacks`)
    - Allows you to specify in which folder the commands should run
    - Only works with `buildType: nixpacks`
    - Example: `"basePath": "./apps"`
    - _Optional_, defaults to "./"

### Redis

`type: 'elasticache'`

<Collapse title="Elasticache service options">

#### About

This service will create a Redis instance using AWS Elasticache with AUTH and Encryption in transit (TLS) enabled by default.

The password and the connection URL(s) will be stored in the SSM Parameter Store in your AWS Account - Flightcontrol does not store it.
The connection URL can also be made available to the other services in the same environment by setting up `connectionStringEnvVarName` (see the docs below for an example).

Besides the AWS Elasticache resource and the SSM Parameter, there are a couple of other AWS resources needed for the architecture which we abstract away, like Subnets and Security Group.

#### Limitations:

- We do not currently support:

  - Changing the cluster configuration after creation, i.e.: the engine version or the instance size.
    This means if you need to make changes after deployment, you will need to delete the service and add a new one with a different ID.

  - AWS Cluster Mode, which includes sharding and multiple clusters under the same service

#### Required Properties

`engine: string`

The cache engine to be created. Supported values: `"redis"`

- Example: `"engine": "redis"`

`instanceSize: string`

- The AWS instance size
- Example: `"instanceSize": "cache.t4g.small"`
- Support values: [See the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/CacheNodes.SupportedTypes.html)
- Changing this after creation will not currently work.

`engineVersion: string`

- Cannot be changed after initial deployment
- Supported values:
  - Redis: ` "7.0", "6.2", "6.0", "5.0.6", "5.0.5", "5.0.4", "5.0.3", "5.0.0", "4.0.10", "3.2.10", "3.2.6", "3.2.4", "2.8.24", "2.8.23", "2.8.22", "2.8.21", "2.8.19", "2.8.6", "2.6.13"`
- Default: `7.0`
- Example: `"engineVersion": "6.2"`

#### Optionals:

`numberOfReplicas: number`

- The number of replicas you want in your Redis service
- Optional with default: `1`

`connectionStringEnvVarName: string`

- The name of the environment variable that will contain the URL for connecting to Redis.
- When this is set, Flightcontrol automatically injects the environment variable to other services in the same environment.
- Optional with NO default
- Example: `"connectionStringEnvVarName": "REDIS_URL"`
  (In this case, REDIS_URL will be available as an env var for any other service in the **same environment**)

`autoUpgradeMinorVersions: boolean`

- Example: `‚ÄúautoUpgradeMinorVersions": true`
- Optional with default: `true`

`port: int`

- Example: `"port": 6379`
- Optional with default:
  - Redis: `6379`

### Configuration Example

Note:

- `name` is what will be displayed in your FC dashboard
- `id` should be unique and is used by FC as the source of truth for your service, changing this will create a new service under the same environment

```json
{
  "id": "redis",
  "type": "elasticache",
  "engine": "redis",
  "name": "My Redis Service",
  "engineVersion": "7.0",
  "instanceSize": "cache.t4g.small"
}
```
