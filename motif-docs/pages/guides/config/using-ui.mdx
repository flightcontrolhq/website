title: Using the Flightcontrol Dashboard
---

If you don't want to maintain your own file, configure your project using our dashboard.

To get started using our dashboard:
1. Connect your AWS account on the AWS Accounts page [here](https://app.flightcontrol.dev/aws-accounts)
2. Start a new project with your GitHub account or a public GitHub repo
3. Configure your deployment on the Prepare for Launch page:
   - Edit project name and select **branch** to be used
   - Select GUI as Config Type
   - Select your deployment **`Environment`** from a fixed list of environment names
   - Optionally choose a framework preset service 
   - Add the **`Services`** you want
     - Select builder type for each service
     - More about services [here](./services)
   - Select the **AWS account** and **AWS region** you want to use
   - Optionally, edit environment variables
 4. Create project!


Current limitations:

- You can only set up ONE `Environment` on creation, but you'll be able to add more once the project has been created.
- You can't select manual trigger, so by default it will deploy every commit pushed to the selected **branch**
