title: Support for Fargate
---

In order to get the Fargate metrics and logging into Datadog, there is a special agent that can be added to any Fargate container to collect this data and pass it to your Datadog. You can read more about how to install this agent manually [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/ecs_fargate/?tab=fluentbitandfirelens).

However this manual process, does not work with how Flightcontrol deploys your application, as the Task Definition gets overridden with each new deployment, and hence there is a need to automatically add the Datadog agent to the Task Definition during the service deployment.

There is now an experimental feature where you can enable Datadog logging for your Fargate service. This is currently supported through our IaC only, we will be adding this feature to our GUI in the near future.

1. In your `flightcontrol.json` file, please add the new experimental `datadog` object.
2. Also add the relative Docker Labels, so Datadog can correctly tag the logs and metrics.

Here is a complete example:

```json
{
  "id": "web",
  "name": "web",
  "type": "fargate",
  "cpu": 0.5,
  "memory": 1,
  "minInstances": 1,
  "maxInstances": 1,
  "dockerLabels": {
    "com.datadoghq.ad.instances": "[{\"host\": \"%%host%%\", \"port\": 3000}]", //change the port if needed
    "com.datadoghq.ad.check_names": "[\"DISPLAY_NAME\"]", // name that will show in datadog
    "com.datadoghq.ad.init_configs": "[{}]"
  },
  "experimental": {
    // make sure the datadog object is added under experimental
    "datadog": {
      "enabled": true,
      "datadogSite": "us5.datadoghq.com", //plaintext
      "datadogApiKey": "<REFRENCE_TO_DD_API_KEY_IN_AWS_PARAMETER_STORE>" //from parameter store, needs to be manually added
      "envVariables": {
        // Environment variables to pass to the datadog agent
        // Similar to regular services variables
        "DD_APM_ENABLED": true,
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: The DataDog agent requires 256MB of memory to run, make sure you configure your instance with enough memory for both your application and the DataDog agent. It is recommended to use the DataDog agent with instance size of minimum 1GB of memory.
