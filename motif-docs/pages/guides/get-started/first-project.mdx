title: Setting up your first AWS project with Flightcontrol

import { Collapse } from '@components/ui/collapse.mdx'

On a high-level, the steps you'll need to follow in order to deploy a project for the first time are:

1. Create an account at Flightcontrol
2. Create an account at AWS (if you don't already have one)
3. Link your AWS account to Flightcontrol
4. Optional: Authorize the Flightcontrol Github App to access your chosen repositories, public or private. _This is needed if you want to deploy your own code from your Github repository._
5. Create a Flightcontrol project from our Dashboard

## Concepts

It might be useful to understand the different terms and the architecture we use:

`Project`: It's the top level element of our architecture. It contains the configuration for the different `Environments` and it is associated with a **Github repository**. It can only be created in the Flightcontrol Dashboard.

`Environment`: The model that contains 1 or more `Service`. It can be configured as a regular (long-lived) environment or as a preview environment (short-lived, spinned off when a pull request is opened).

`Services`: The AWS service that you want to be contained within a given `Environment`.

`Deployment`: Each deploy of an `Environment` will generate a `Deployment` that attempts to deploy all child `Services`. In the very first deployment, Flightcontrol will also configure the required AWS environment resources, depending on what is required by each service.


## Supported services

At the moment, we support the following services:

- **Web server** using Fargate
- **Workers** using Fargate
- **Database** using RDS
- **Static websites** using S3 and Cloudfront

Read more about each type [here](./services).

## Configuring a Project

When you create the project in the **Flightcontrol Dashboard**, you can choose to configure it using (a) our UI _or_ (b) by providing a `flightcontrol.json` file, which needs to exist in the codebase you want to deploy.

During the project creation in the Dashboard, you'll select **which repository to use** as well as which type of configuration you prefer.

In the configuration, among other things, you'll configure an `Environment` and which `Services` you want to deploy. This configuration also includes how you want your changes to sync with Flightcontrol, either **manually** or on **changes pushed**.

See the [config page](/guides/config) for more info.
