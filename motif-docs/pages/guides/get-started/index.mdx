If this is you first time deploying your project with Flightcontrol, you can head over to [Setting up your first project](/guides/get-started/first-project) section to learn the basics.

Otherwise, here are some sections you might find useful:

- [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting)
- [Changelog](/changelog)
- [How To Get Free AWS Credits](/guides/get-started/aws-credits)

You can also get support and reach out to the community on our [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/yY8rSPrD6q).
