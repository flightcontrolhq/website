title: Run Prisma Studio on Flightcontrol
---

Prisma Studio is a great GUI to directly access your database. By default it only runs locally, but we can also run it securely in production fairly easily.

We use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as a reverse proxy in front of Prisma Studio to add HTTP Basic Auth to ensure that no one else can access your DB!

1. Add `Caddyfile` in your project root with the following:
    ```
    {
      debug
      admin off
    }

    # Note: the urls use `http`, not `https` because `https` is added at a higher layer
    http://admin.yourproductiondomain.com {
      reverse_proxy 0.0.0.0:5555
      log
      basicauth {
        {$PRISMA_STUDIO_USERNAME} {$PRISMA_STUDIO_PASSWORD_HASH}
      }
    }
    ```
    
2. Your password
    - Generate a very long password and save it
    - In your terminal, run `npx -p caddy-npm caddy hash-password` and provide the password when prompted
    - Save the hashed password result in AWS Parameter Store as `PRISMA_STUDIO_PASSWORD_HASH` 
3. Add the following to the `services` array in your `flightcontrol.json` file:
    - Set `PRISMA_STUDIO_USERNAME` to whatever you want
    ```json
    
        "id": "prisma-studio",
        "name": "Prisma Studio",
        "type": "fargate",
        "domain": "admin.yourproductiondomain.com",
        "cpu": 0.25,
        "memory": 0.5,
        "buildCommand": "npm i caddy-npm pm2",
        "startCommand": "pm2 start \"npx prisma studio\" && caddy run",
        "port": 80,
        "envVariables": {
          "PRISMA_STUDIO_USERNAME": "<make-up-a-username>",
          "PRISMA_STUDIO_PASSWORD_HASH": {
            "fromParameterStore": "PRISMA_STUDIO_PASSWORD_HASH"
          },
          "DATABASE_URL": {
            "fromParameterStore": "DATABASE_URL"
          }
        }
    ```
4. Deploy using `git push`
5. Once Flightcontrol shows you the DNS changes for your custom domain, make those updates in your DNS settings.
    - A custom domain is currently required, but you can use any domain.
6. Once DNS has been verified, you can access prisma studio at your specified domain!
