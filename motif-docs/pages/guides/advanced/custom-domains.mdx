## Root Domains Recommends

### Use the `www` Subdomain Instead of the Root Domain

We recommend you add a subdomain (i.e.: use `www.example.com`) instead of directly referencing the root domain (`example.com`).

If you go with this recommendation but still want users to be able to use `example.com`, please contact us and we will add a redirection for you.

### Root Domain Requires ALIAS Support

If you still prefer to setup a root domain, make sure that it accepts an ALIAS DNS Record, which is a custom one not supported by all providers (Namecheap is one that does).

## Setup Your Custom Domain

To connect a custom domain, you'll need to follow these high-level steps:

1. Add the domain to your Flightcontrol service configuration
2. Retrieve the DNS changes needed for the domain redirect in the Flightcontrol dashboard
3. Apply the changes to your domain provider

### Add The Domain To Your Flightcontrol Service

#### Using The UI

If you've created your project using the UI, you can add your domain to the `Custom Domain` field of the service you desire.
To access it, go to the environment where your service is, then click "Edit" and scroll to the "Services" section then save the changes.

#### Using `flightcontrol.json`

If your project is configured using `flightcontrol.json`, you'll need to add the `domain` config to your service then push the changes to trigger a new deployment.

### DNS Changes

Once the domain information is saved, we trigger a new deployment. Once this happens, the required DNS changes will be visible in the Flightcontrol dashboard, in the environment for this service.

They will look something like this if you have added a **subdomain**:

/>

<Note type="warning">
  ⚠️ If you add a root domain, you will also see information for an ALIAS record that you need to
  set. An ALIAS record is a custom DNS record and it is not supported by all providers. This is one
  of the reasons why we do not recommend root domains.
</Note>

### Apply Changes To Your Domain Provider

The specific instructions will depend on whether you are setting up a root or subdomain,

#### For a Subdomain

The DNS changes for a subdomain are the most straightforward. As you can see from the screenshot above, you'll get 2 CNAME records.

You'll need to add those records to your domain provider.

Here are some guides from different providers:

### For a Root Domain

With this option, things become less straightforward.

The most important thing to be aware of is that **your domain provider NEEDS to support an ALIAS record**, if they don't you'll need to move the domain to one that does or fallback to the subdomain option.
If they do support it, then you should be able to set it up by adding the DNS records as shown to you by Flightcontrol (see external articles above with some examples).

However, please note that that Flightcontrol can't verify if the ALIAS record was setup correctly since this record type is an internal translation and won’t appear in the nameserver response.
So we only just check if CNAME is correct and assume the setup has been successful.

Lastly, if you have used Route53 as your domain provider, your domain needs to be in the same account as the service AND you'll need to configure things slightly differently.
When you create the ALIAS record, instead of using the CloudFront domain, you have to choose the exact Cloudfront distribution that was created by Flightcontrol.

## Wildcard Domains

Besides the 2 options discussed at length, we also support wildcard domains, i.e.:
`"domain": "*.example.com"`

With this option you can make use of the `HOST` HTTP Request Header sent to your app to see the exact domain being used and the configuration is the same as for the subdomain.

## FAQ

<Collapse title="I have added the domain but still haven't made the DNS changes. Can I still access my service?">
  Yes, you can still access the service using the random generated `x.cloudfront.net` domain. This
  domain can be found under AWS Resources -> `cloudfrontDomain`
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="Why do you recommend using subdomain instead of root domain?">
  When you use a root domain to host an app, all cookies on that root level are shared with its
  child subdomains (i.e. every single subdomain) which might cause cookies collision and sharing the
  cookie with a 3rd party that is using a CNAME from your domain.

Besides that, root domains requires that you set an ALIAS record (a custom implementation of an A record), which removes the benefits of distributed CDN due to how it resolves the IP.
