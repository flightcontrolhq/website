Watch Paths are [glob patterns](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features) that can be used to filter which services are built and deployed.

This is typically used in monorepos where you don't want all services to deploy just because of a tiny change to one of them.

For example, if on your frontend service you set a watch path of `apps/frontend/**` then this service will only build & deploy if a changed file is detected in `apps/frontend/`. 
                                                                                 
We use a git diff from the last successful deployment to compute this.
