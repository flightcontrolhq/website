# Supported Types

## Nixpacks
You can specify a specific build & start command, although we will provide you with an intelligent default based on your language and framework.

## Node.js (legacy)
You can specify a specific build & start command, although we will provide you with an intelligent default based on your language and framework.

## Docker
You must specify the path and the context path from the repo root.

## Pull From Image Registry
This build type allows you to use a pre-built image. You must first create an image registry. Then, you specify the repository and the image tag to point to the image you want us to use. See [Deploying Your Own Image](./deploying-own-image) for more details on how to deploy your own image.

## From Service
This build type allows you to copy another service's built image. Currently, this is only supported using code.
