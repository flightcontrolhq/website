If the user receiving a similar error while deploying a `fargate` or `fargate-worker` service:
```
[
  {
    "type": "FARGATE_DEPLOY_ERROR",
    "message": "Cannotpullcontainererror: ref pull has been retried 1 time(s): failed to extract layer: <layer_id> no space left on device: unknown"
  }
]
```
Consider increasing the ECS Fargate task storage. By default, AWS assigns 20GB for each task, but can increase this value up to 200GB. For more details about Fargate task storage check the [AWS Fargate task storage page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/fargate-task-storage.html).

In order to change the task storage for the service:
- If using IaC configuration, add `storage: 100` property to the configuration file. This will configure the Fargate task with 100GB.
- If using Flightcontrol GUI dashboard, the user can increase the storage under the service **Advanced** settings.
