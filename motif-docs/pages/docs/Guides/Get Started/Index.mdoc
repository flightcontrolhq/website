If this is you first time deploying your project with Flightcontrol, you can head over to the [Setting your first project](/docs/guides/get-started/first-project) section to learn the basics.

Otherwise, here are some sections you might find useful:

- [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting)
- [Changelog](/docs/changelog)
- [How To Get Free AWS Credits](/docs/guides/get-started/aws-credits)


You can also get support and reach out to the community on our [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/yY8rSPrD6q).
