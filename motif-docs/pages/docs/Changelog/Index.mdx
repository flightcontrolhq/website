<ChangelogEntry date="2022-08-01" title="VPC Enhancement &  Stale-while-revalidate Feature v2">
ðŸš€ Ability to connect environments to an existing VPC instead of creating a new one! (docs: https://flightcontrol.notion.site/Flightcontrol-Docs-8d9ca4edb5564165a9557df32818af0c#c0a138ebca8a45dcbbc26a2878cf038c)

ðŸš€ Shipped v2 of our stale-while-revalidate feature, allowing it to work well for many edge cases, including very large responses and when your response etag changes on every request. You'll want to enable this if you are using Next.js ISR
